## Codewars
Your job is to implement head, tail, init, and last functions in Java Script. Make sure it doesn't edit the array; that would cause problems!

Solution:

```
function head(arr) {
  return arr[0];
}

function tail(arr2) {
  return arr2.slice(1);
}

function init(arr3) {
  var i = arr3.length - 1;
  return arr3.slice(0,i).concat(arr3.slice(i+1));
}

function last(arr4) {
  var arrl = arr4[arr4.length-1];
  return arrl;
}
```
